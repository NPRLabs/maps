small unknown bugs:
while inserting address on mobile and moving to landscape the css doesn't switch
need to think about how lat/long are slightly different than the contour center
make more precise the callsign finding fallthrough
caching--may be hard
SWITCH TO USING ROW FACTORY

We need multiple things:

updates:
    new entries: add line, super easy, connect with organization
        organization might just be an organization id, and then have a file that    
        lists the organizations or something like that. maybe too many orgs tho
    update entries: just write over the line in the file, might not work if length
        changes, might need to just rewrite over the file.
    

probably the buggiest part of this project is updater
