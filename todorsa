Things to do RE the Tektronix RSA306

Seems the gps functionality is usb into the computer, and requires different software,
RSA Maps. This is either part of a different software package (?) or possibly
standalone. We need to figure out if its worth buying, or if we have it somehow.

Still need to figure out the trigger, to trigger recording of the data, tho this may be possible to do within the program, and not require

Also still need to confirm the non-importance (or possible importance) of the 


This device measures in dbm
but we need values in dbuv for field strength calculations:


I have determined that (most likely) the conversion is as follows:

value in dBuV = value in dBm + 90 + 10*log_10_(Impendance (50 ohms)) or equivalently:
value in dBuV = value in dBm + 90 + 10*ln(Impendance (50 ohms))/ln(10)

we may want to use a trigger to save, otherwise aquisition is not working well, it doesn't save in a reasonable format, where as triggers can save as csvs
